 Mix the milk and vinegar and let it sit for a minute or two (you’re making
 “buttermilk” here).
 Whisk the dry ingredients together. Whisk the egg, milk, and melted butter
 into the dry ingredients until just combined.
 Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat. Melt a little smear of butter in the
 pan (essential for giving a yummy golden brown crust).
 Pour about 1/3 cup of batter into the hot skillet and spread it flat-like (it will
 be pretty thick). Arrange a few blueberries on top. Cook until you see little
 bubbles on top and the edges starting to firm up. Flip and cook for another 1
2 minutes until the pancakes are sky-high fluffy and cooked through.
 Serve with butter and maple syrup. But honestly, sometimes I just like to eat
 these plain. YUM, YUM, YUM
